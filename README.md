# khiyali-word-game

My niece made up a cool cryptography game when she was six. She'd give me a phrase that was encrypted with a cipher she'd generate on the fly by assigning each letter to a different letter of the alphabet. Then I'd have to guess, e.g. "Does E mean T?" and when I guessed correctly, she'd re-write the encrypted phrase with the decrypted letters in lowercase. At any point, I could guess the phrase if I was ready. I thought this was pretty cool and I've finally coded it up in Python. She's eleven now :)
